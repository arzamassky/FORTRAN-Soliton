"user_soliton.F90"
My undergraduate thesis work about the interaction of laser pulse with plasma to create an ultrashort pulse for the study of biological structures.
I did PIC simulations with Fortran code called TRISTAN-MP. 
I did not change the code, but I've written an additional package for my particular problem.
